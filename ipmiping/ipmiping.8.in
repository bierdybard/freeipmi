.TH IPMIPING 8 "April 2004" "ipmiping @VERSION@" "System Commands"
.SH NAME
ipmiping \- send IPMI Get Authentication Capabilitiy request to network hosts 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ipmiping [OPTIONS] destination
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ipmiping
uses the IPMI Get Authentication Capabilities request datagram to
elicit an IPMI Get Authentication Capabilitiesl response from a remote
host.  The utility can be used to verify if a remote host supports
IPMI.

.B ipmiping 
will return 0 to the environment if it receives atleast 1 response 
from the remote host.  Otherwise, it exists with a value of 1.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are available 
.TP
.I "-h"
Output help menu.
.TP
.I "-V"
Output version.
.TP
.I "-c count"
Stop after sending 
.I count
request packets.
.TP
.I "-i interval"
Wait 
.I interval 
seconds between sending each packet.  The default is to wait for one
second between each packet.
.TP
.I "-I interface address"

.TP
.I "-v"
Verbose output.
.if @WITH_DEBUG@ \{
.TP
.I "-d"

.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
It has been observed that some remote BMCs can get "confused" and
delay packet responses if duplicate packets are sent in succession
very quickly.  For example, this could happen if the user repeatedly
executes "ipmiping -c 1 destination" very quickly.  There is no known
way to cleanly deal with a "confused" BMC.  The best option is to
simply wait "awhile".
.SH ORIGIN
Developed by Albert Chu <chu11@llnl.gov>.  Command and manpage
based off 
.B ping(8).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
