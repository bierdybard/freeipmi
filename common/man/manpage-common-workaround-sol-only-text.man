.LP
"authcap" - This workaround option will skip early checks for username
capabilities, authentication capabilities, and K_g support and allow
IPMI authentication to succeed.  It works around multiple issues in
which the remote system does not properly report username
capabilities, authentication capabilities, or K_g status.  Those
hitting this issue may see "username invalid", "authentication type
unavailable for attempted privilege level", or "k_g invalid" errors.
Issue observed on Asus P5M2/P5MT-R/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel SR1520ML/X38ML,
and Sun Fire 2200/4150/4450 with ELOM.
.LP
"intel20" - This workaround option will work around several Intel IPMI
2.0 authentication issues.  The issues covered include padding of
usernames, automatic acceptance of a RAKP 4 response integrity check
when using the integrity algorithm MD5-128, and password truncation if
the authentication algorithm is HMAC-MD5-128.  Those hitting this
issue may see "username invalid", "password invalid", or "k_g invalid"
errors.  Issue observed on Intel SE7520AF2 with Intel Server
Management Module (Professional Edition).
.LP
"supermicro20" - This workaround option will work around several early
Supermicro IPMI 2.0 authentication issues.  The issues covered include
handling invalid length authentication codes.  Those hitting this
issue may see "password invalid" errors.  Issue observed on Supermicro
H8QME with SIMSO daughter card.  Confirmed fixed on newerver firmware.
.LP
"sun20" - This workaround option will work work around several Sun
IPMI 2.0 authentication issues.  The issues covered include invalid
lengthed hash keys, improperly hashed keys, and invalid cipher suite
records.  Those hitting this issue may see "password invalid" or "bmc
error" errors.  Issue observed on Sun Fire 4100/4200/4500 with ILOM.
.LP
"opensesspriv" - This workaround option will slightly alter FreeIPMI's
IPMI 2.0 connection protocol to workaround an invalid hashing
algorithm used by the remote system.  The privilege level sent during
the Open Session stage of an IPMI 2.0 connection is used for hashing
keys instead of the privilege level sent during the RAKP1 connection
stage.  Those hitting this issue may see "password invalid" or "bad
rmcpplus status code" errors.  Issue observed on Inventec 5441/Dell
Xanadu2 and Supermicro X8DTH.
.LP
"solpayloadsize" - This workaround option will not check for valid SOL
payload sizes and assume a proper set.  It works around remote systems
that report invalid IPMI 2.0 SOL payload sizes.  Those hitting this
issue may see "BMC Implementation" errors.  Issue observed on Asus
P5M2/RS162-E4/RX4, Intel SR1520ML/X38ML, Inventec 5441/Dell Xanadu2
and Sun x4100.
.LP
"solport" - This workaround option will ignore alternate SOL ports
specified during the protocol.  It works around remote systems that
report invalid alternate SOL ports.  Those hitting this issue may see
"session timeout" errors.  Issue observed on Asus P5MT-R.
.LP
"solstatus" - This workaround option will not check the current
activation status of SOL during the protocol setup.  It works around
remote systems that do not properly support this command.  Those
hitting this issue may see "BMC Error" errors.  Issue observed on
Supermicro X8SIL-F.
