\fB\-\-show\-sensor\-type\fR
Show the sensor type for each entry.  On many systems, the sensor type
is redundant to the name of the sensor.  This can especially be true
if \fB\-\-entity\-sensor\-names\fR is specified.  If the sensor name
is not sufficient, or if the sensor type is of interest to the user,
this option can be specified to list the sensor type in an additional
column of output.
