\fB\-\-no\-sensor\-type\-output\fR
Do not output the sensor type for each entry.  On some systems, the
sensor type column output may be redundant to the name of the sensor.
This can especially be true if \fB\-\-entity\-sensor\-names\fR is
specified.  If the user wishes to condense output, this option can be
specified to remove the sensor type column output.
