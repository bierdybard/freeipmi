GNU FreeIPMI would not be what it is today without the invaluable help
of everybody who was kind enough to spend time testing it and
reporting bugs. 

The following people made especially gracious contributions of their
time and energy in helping to track down bugs, add new features, and
generally assist in the GNU FreeIPMI maintainership process:
