FreeIPMI Testing

The following is a (semi) detailed list of tests to measure the
compliance of a motherboard to IPMI as well as FreeIPMI's compliance
to the motherboard's implementation.  It is not 100% thorough, but
covers a fair amount of the IPMI specification.

This document is updated for FreeIPMI release 0.8.1.

All documentation below assume reasonably advanced knowledge of IPMI
and knowledge of FreeIPMI tools.  Please see the IPMI specification or
FreeIPMI documentation/manpages for additional information.

I am writing this document based primarily upon recollection of tests
I've done in the past.  All vendors are free to challenge me on all
points listed below, such as mandatory vs. optional requirements, etc.

Bmc-config Testing
------------------

Bmc-info Testing
----------------

Execute bmc-info with default output

Verify:

- Executes to completion
- All fields output are correct.  Key fields to verify:
  * Firmware Revision
  * IPMI Version
  * Manufacturer ID
    o The name of the manufacter outputs
 
      i.e. "Manufacturer ID       : SOME-COMPANY (1234)"
           vs.
           "Manufacturer ID       : 1234"
      
      If the above is not the case, and the vendor is registered with
      IANA, is there a firmware bug?

  * Product ID
  * GUID
  * Channel Information - Medium Type
    o If IPMI over LAN is supported, atleast one should be == "802.3 LAN"
  * Channel Information - Vendor ID
    o Most if not all should be == "Intelligent Platform Management Interface forum (7154)"

Ipmi-sensors Testing
--------------------

Execute ipmi-sensors with very verbose output (-vv)

Verify:

- Executes to completion
- All fields output are correct.  Key fields to verify:
  * Entity ID
    o The name of the Entity ID outputs 

      i.e. "Entity ID: system board (7)"
           vs.
           "Entity ID: 7"

      If the above is not the case, are all the Entity IDs valid?  Do they
      belong in the proper ranges defined by the IPMI specification?

Ipmi-sel Testing

In-Band KCS Testing

Out-of-Band Testing
