FreeIPMI Testing

The following is a (semi) detailed list of tests to measure the
compliance of a motherboard to IPMI as well as FreeIPMI's compliance
to the motherboard's implementation.  It is not 100% thorough, but
covers a fair amount of the IPMI specification.

This document is updated for FreeIPMI release 0.8.1.

All documentation below assume reasonably advanced knowledge of IPMI
and knowledge of FreeIPMI tools.  Please see the IPMI specification or
FreeIPMI documentation/manpages for additional information.

I am writing this document based primarily upon recollection of tests
I've done in the past.  All vendors are free to challenge me on all
points listed below, such as mandatory vs. optional requirements, etc.

Bmc-config Testing
------------------

Bmc-info Testing
----------------

Execute bmc-info with default output

Verify:

- Executes to completion
- All fields output are correct.  Key fields to verify:
  * Firmware Revision
  * IPMI Version
  * Manufacturer ID
    - The name of the manufacter outputs along with the "Manufacturer ID"
    - i.e. "Manufacturer ID       : SOME-COMPANY (1234)"
           vs.
           "Manufacturer ID       : 1234"
  * Product ID
  * GUID
  * Channel Information - Medium Type
    o If IPMI over LAN is supported, atleast one should be == "802.3 LAN"
  * Channel Information - Vendor ID
    o Most if not all should be == "Intelligent Platform Management Interface forum (7154)"
