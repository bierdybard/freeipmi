.PP
A tool, daemon, and library for IPMI node detection.
.PP
.SH "Getting Started with IPMI"
IPMI can be used in-band (i.e. running on a machine locally) or
out-of-band (i.e. connecting remotely).
.PP
Most FreeIPMI tools can operate in-band by using one of the in-band
drivers included.  These in-band drivers include a direct KCS
interface driver, a SSIF driver through the SSIF device
(i.e. /dev/i2c-0), and the Linux OpenIPMI kernel driver
(i.e. /dev/ipmi0).  If your system requires the use of installed
drivers, those appropriate modules must be installed ahead of time.
However, most systems should automatically load these drivers when
appropriate.
.PP
Under most scenarios, the FreeIPMI tools should automatically discover
which in-band interface to use and the proper settings to use.
However, some motherboards may require you to determine driver type,
addresses, paths, etc. on your own and pass them as command line
options to the tools.  You may use 
.B ipmi-locate(8) 
to help determine
this information.  Other tools such as 
.B dmidecode(8)
may also provide
this information.
.PP
To use IPMI out-of-band with tools such as 
.B ipmipower(8) 
or
.B ipmi-sensors(8), 
the remote machine's BMC must first be configured for out of band
communication.  Typically, this involves setting a username, password,
IP address, MAC address, and a few other parameters.  This can be done
using the tool
.B bmc-config(8).  

Additional information on how to configure with
.B bmc-config(8) 
can be found
in the
.B bmc-config.conf(5) 
manpage.  Some vendors may pre-configure their motherboards with
default values so that 
.B bmc-config(8)
can be used remotely to configure the machine.  However, most of the
time, the BMC must be configured in-band before out-of-band access can
be allowed (for example, the correct IP address and MAC address must
be configured).

.PP
In order to remotely connect to a machine, you typically must specify
the host, username, and password for the tool in order to connect.
Depending on configuration settings, a K_g key, privilege level,
authentication type, cipher suite id, or protocol version may need to
be specified.  Some vendors may have not implemented IPMI properly and
a vendor specific workaround may also be necessary.  See tool manpages
for more information and general trouble-shooting information.

.SH "HPC Support"
Much of FreeIPMI was written with HPC support in mind.  The
configuration tools 
.B bmc-config(8), 
.B pef-config(8), 
and
.B ipmi-sensors-config(8) 
come with file input/output support so that configuration can be
copied and verified across nodes in a cluster.  Most tools (like
.B ipmipower(8) 
and 
.B ipmi-sensors(8)
) come with hostrange support so multiple hosts can be specified on
the command line at the same time and IPMI can be executed against
the hosts in parallel .  See tool manpages for more information.
Also see the document freeipmi-hostrange.txt for detailed usage and
explanation.  The 
.B ipmimonitoring(8) 
tool interprets sensor readings as well as just reporting them.  By
mapping sensor readings into NOMINAL, WARNING, or CRITICAL states, it
makes monitoring sensors easier across large numbers of nodes.
