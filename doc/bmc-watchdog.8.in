.SH NAME
bmc-watchdog \- BMC watchdog timer daemon and control utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bmc-watchdog command [OPTIONS] [COMMAND_OPTIONS]...
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bmc-watchdog
controls a Base Management Controller (BMC) watchdog timer.  The
.B bmc-watchdog
tool can be used to control a watchdog timer either as a cronjob or a
daemon.  A user must be root in order to run
.B bmc-watchdog. 

.SH BMC WATCHDOG DETAILS
A BMC watchdog timer is part of the Intelligent Platform Management
Interface (IPMI) specification and is only available to BMCs that are
compliant with IPMI.  When a BMC watchdog timer is started, it begins
counting down to zero from some positive number of seconds.  When the
timer hits zero, the timer will execute a pre-configured timeout
action.  A BMC watchdog timer may also generate an pre-timeout
interrupt prior to the timer hitting zero.

In order to stop the pre-timeout interrupt or timeout action from
being generated, the watchdog timer must periodically be reset back to
its initial beginning value.

The BMC watchdog timer automatically stops itself when the machine is
powered down, power cycled, hard reset, or soft reset.  By default, a
BMC is stopped when a machine is brought up.  Therefore, after a
machine is brought up, a BMC watchdog timer must be setup again before
it can be used.

Typically, a BMC watchdog timer is used to automatically reset a
machine that has crashed.  When the operating system first starts up,
the BMC timer is set to its initial countdown value.  At periodic
intervals, when the operating system is functioning properly, the
watchdog timer is periodically reset so the timer does not countdown
to zero.  When the system crashes, the timer cannot be reset by the
operating system or a userspace program.  Eventually, the timer will
reach zero and can reset the machine.

.SH COMMANDS
The following commands are available to
.B bmc-watchdog.
.TP
.B  -s, --set                       
Set BMC Watchdog Configuration.  BMC watchdog timer configuration
values can be set using the set command options listed below under SET
OPTIONS.  If a particular configuration parameter is not specified on
the command line, the current configuration of that parameter will not
be changed.
.TP
.B  -g, --get                       
Get BMC Watchdog Configuration and State.  The current
configuration and state is printed to standard output.
.TP
.B  -r, --reset                     
Reset BMC Watchdog Timer.  
.TP
.B  -t, --start                     
Start BMC Watchdog Timer.  Identical to --reset command when the
timer is stopped.  Does nothing if the timer is currently running.
.TP
.B  -y, --stop                      
Stop BMC Watchdog Timer.  Stops the current timer.
.TP
.B  -c, --clear                     
Clear BMC Watchdog Configuration.  Clears all configuration values
for the watchdog timer, except for timer use, which is kept at 
its currently value.
.TP
.B  -d, --daemon
Run 
.B bmc-watchdog 
as a daemon.  Configurable BMC watchdog timer options are listed below
under DAEMON OPTIONS.  The configuration values are set once, then the
daemon will reset the timer at specified periodic intervals.
Everytime the BMC watchdog timer is reset, a syslog entry will be
generated.  This can be disabled using the --no-syslog option listed
below.  The daemon can be stopped using the --stop or --clear command
above, or by setting the stop_timer flag on the --set command.  
.SH OPTIONS
The following options can be used by any command.
.TP
.B  -o INT, --io-port=INT
Identify the System Base Address for KCS SMS/IO.  By default, 0x08A2 is
used.  If the io-port number is prefixed with a "0x", it is assumed to
be a base 16 integer.  Otherwise, it is assumed to be a base 10 integer.
.TP
.B  -n, --no-syslog
Turns off all syslogging done by 
.B bmc-watchdog.  
This option is particularly useful if you find syslog messages from
the bmc-watchdog daemon mode filling up the syslog too quickly.
.if @WITH_DEBUG@ \{
.TP
.B  -D, --debug
Turns on debugging.  All data written and read from the BMC is dumped
to stderr.
\}
.SH SET OPTIONS
The following options can be used by the set command to set or clear
various BMC watchdog configuration parameters.
.TP
.B  -u INT, --timer-use=INT
Set timer use.  The timer use value can be set to one of the
following: 1 = BIOS FRB2, 2 = BIOS POST, 3 = OS_LOAD, 4 = SMS OS, 5 =
OEM.
.TP
.B  -m INT, --stop-timer=INT
Set Stop Timer Flag.  A flag value of 0 stops the current BMC watchdog
timer.  A value of 1 doesn't turn off the current watchdog timer.
.TP
.B  -l INT, --log=INT
Set Log Flag.  A flag value of 0 turns logging on.  A value of 1 turns
logging off.
.TP
.B  -a INT, --timeout-action=INT
Set timeout action.  The timeout action can be set to one of the
following: 0 = No action, 1 = Hard Reset, 2 = Power Down, 3 = Power
Cycle.
.TP
.B  -p INT, --pre-timeout-interrupt=INT
Set pre-timeout interrupt.  The pre timeout interrupt can be set to
one of the following: 0 = None, 1 = SMI, 2 = NMI, 3 = Messaging
Interrupt.
.TP
.B  -z SECS, --pre-timeout-interval=SECS  
Set pre-timeout interval in seconds.
.TP
.B  -F, --clear-bios-frb2
Clear  BIOS FRB2 Timer Use Flag.
.TP
.B  -P, --clear-bios-post
Clear BIOS POST Timer Use Flag.
.TP
.B  -L, --clear-os-load
Clear OS Load Timer Use Flag.
.TP
.B  -S, --clear-sms-os
Clear SMS/OS Timer Use Flag.
.TP

Clear OEM Timer Use Flag.
.TP
.B  -i SECS, --initial-countdown=SECS
Set initial countdown in seconds.
.TP
.B  -w, --start-after-set
Start timer after set command if timer is stopped.  This is typically
used when
.B bmc-watchdog
is used as a cronjob.  This can be used to automatically start the
timer after it has been set the first time.
.TP
.B  -x, --reset-after-set
Reset timer after set command if timer is running.
.TP
.B  -j, --start-if-stopped
Don't execute set command if timer is stopped, just start timer.
.TP
.B  -k, --reset-if-running
Don't execute set command if timer is running, just reset timer. This
is typically used when
.B bmc-watchdog
is used as a cronjob.  This can be used to reset the timer after it
has been initially started.

.SH DAEMON OPTIONS
The following options can be used by the daemon command to set the
initial BMC watchdog configuration parameters.
.TP
.B  -u INT, --timer-use=INT

.SH "ERRORS"
Errors are logged to the syslog LOG_DAEMON facility when 
.B bmc-watchdog
is run in daemon mode.  Otherwise, it is logged to the LOG_CRON
facility.

.SH KNOWN ISSUES
.B Bmc-watchdog
may fail to reset the watchdog timer if it is not scheduled properly.
It is always recommended that 
.B bmc-watchdog
be executed with a high scheduling priority.

On some machines, the hardware based SMI Handler may disable a
processor after a watchdog timer timeout if the timer use is set to
something other than SMS/OS.
