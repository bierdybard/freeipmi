  - serial-cmds
  - sol-cmds
  - pef-cmds
  - sdr-repo-cmds

  - sdr-record-types
  - sel record-types
  - sensor-cmds
* Modify system boot priority table.

pef-config
--------
* pef-config renamed to pef-config
* .8 manpage and conf.5 manpage
* how to deal with channel number for alert policy table
* alert strings

  - better input for most of event filter section

bmc-config/pef-config
-------------------
better parsing/caching for faster commit/checkout
mem-leaks from strdups, is this ever freed?
get functions - too much duplication, can be condensed - need to re-architect in some way

general
-------
timeout options for most FreeIPMI tools?
ipmi 2.0 for all tools?
sdr caching requires versioning
tool for getting channel information - in ipmi-device tool for 0.5.0?

code cleanup
------------
param->parameter everywyhere 
- after ipmi-chassis committed
common funcs for udm setup in tools
common funcs for pstdout setup in tools
common funcs for sdr init junk in tools
common stuff for SDR options in manpages
common stuff for parsing in bmc-config and pef-config

re-architecture
---------------
merge in freeipmi-udm
- after ipmi-chassis, ipmi-fru, and pef-config committed
- for 0.4.0 or 0.5.0?
add header comments to fiid.h
