[HIGH PRIORITY]
  * FreeIPMI Hackers Guide.
  * FreeIPMI FAQ.

    both LAN and KCS APIs.
  * Rest of other notable IPMI commands.
  * Modify system boot priority table.

  * FRU Commands (SDR Repo does a similar job).
  * Set Asset Tag

Al's TODO list
==============

Libfreeipmi

- 19.3 Suspend BMC ARPs command
- IPMI 1.5 Errata - Get Chassis Status 
- Consider encapsulating length, ids, types in fiid_obj_t
  and fiid_template_t down the road.
- ipmi_sdr_repo_cache_seek: Add hash/array pointers to avoid
  seeking.  Will probably require a "load and create" wrapper
  function of some sort.
- Feature to allow atomicity of multiple IPMI commands in a row.
  - May or may not be possible.  Think about it.
  
Fish

- Create makefile wrappers to allow fish to work locally in
  build directory rather that requiring installation.

Bmc-watchdog

- Add probing for proper base address
- Add suspend arp options
- Add autoconf option to specify default kcs port address 

General

Autoconf issues:
- socklet_t, doesn't exist on all OSes.
- stdarg.h, other OSes use varargs.h
- bittypes.h and inttypes.h for u_int32_t, etc.

Testsuite for Freeipmi and IPMI conformance test.

Need to test following corner cases:
- 16 byte passwords
- passwords with spaces

Bala's TODO List:
