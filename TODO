AB's TODO list
==============
libfreeipmi:
------------
[HIGH PRIORITY]
  * Nil

[MEDIUM PRIORITY]
  * Missing IPMI commands.
  * Modify system boot priority table.

[LOW PRIORITY]
  * FRU Commands (SDR Repo does a similar job).
  * Command to Switch MUX between BMC and ttyS1

Al's TODO list
==============
libfreeipmi:
------------
  * IPMI 1.5 Errata - Get Chassis Status 
  * Consider encapsulating length, ids, types in fiid_obj_t
    and fiid_template_t down the road.
  * ipmi_sdr_repo_cache_seek: Add hash/array pointers to avoid
    seeking.  Will probably require a "load and create" wrapper
    function of some sort.
  * Feature to allow atomicity of multiple IPMI commands in a row.
    May or may not be possible.  Think about it.
  
fish:
-----
  * Create makefile wrappers to allow fish to work locally in
    build directory rather that requiring installation.

bmc-watchdog:
-------------
  * Add probing for proper base address
  * Require Timer use to be SMS/OS?
  * Make get_lan_channel_number() non-hardcoded.
  * Ignore pre-timeout interval length comparison to initial countdown
    if pre-timeout interval is none

ipmipower:
----------
  * Research and implement better packet analysis algorithms.
  * Output warning/error/message/something in autoconf if ipmipower
    cannot be compiled with locked pages??
  * There are probably port issues with mmap/mlock.
  * Re-implement BMC workaround to use ports less wastefully.
  * Buffer recently malloced space to avoid constant re-mallocing.
  * Add readline or similar functionality in interactive mode.

ipmiping/rmcpping:
------------------
  * Make starting sequence number random to reduce probability of
    "confused" BMC known issue?
  * Randomizing port on client can also fix the issue??

General:
--------
  * Testsuite for Freeipmi and IPMI conformance test.
  * Need to test following corner cases:
    - 16 byte passwords
    - passwords with spaces
  * New tools?
    - SEL collector/logger thingie for clusters
    - tool/script to detect busted BMC/IORiser
    - bmc-config wrapper script to handle common stuff
     - i.e. if you enable a user, automatically turn on
      IPMI lan and IPMI serial, passwd/md2 authentication, etc.

Autoconf issues:
----------------
  * Cleanup use of autoconf defs.  i.e. use "/* HAVE_FOO_H */" and
   etc.
  * socklet_t, doesn't exist on all OSes.
  * stdarg.h, other OSes use varargs.h
  * bittypes.h and inttypes.h for u_int32_t, etc.
  * default io-port config option?
         
Bala's TODO List:
=================
  * lan based sensors, sel and bmc-info
  * bmc-config --auto-configure
  * automatic channel probing
  * sensors will be simplified with Scheme
  * Set assert tag
  * dual fiid for ipmi_kcs_lan_set_auth_type_enables

Ian's TODO List:
================
  * Convert fish to the (now preferred) scm_ interface completely.
  * Event Messaging and PEF Subsystem.
  * Debian packages.
  * Enable build without fish (not depending on readline and guile).
  * When building with fish, fail configure if prerequisites aren't present.

Later on:
=========
  * Host monitoring support: Ganglia integration.
