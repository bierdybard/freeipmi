  - acpi
  - ssif
  - pef config

AB's TODO list
==============
libfreeipmi:
------------
[HIGH PRIORITY]
  * Unified Driver Model (one interface for all in-band and out-of-band drivers)

[MEDIUM PRIORITY]
  * Missing IPMI commands.
  * Modify system boot priority table.

[LOW PRIORITY]
  * FRU Commands (SDR Repo does a similar job).

documentation
-------------
bmc-autoconfig, still exists? 
ipmi-sensors options and output once C version is done

Al's TODO list
==============
rpm
---
Redo packages once re-org is complete
  * freeipmi - lib + most utils
  * freeipmi-devel - devel libs
  * freeipmi-bmcwatchdog
  * freeipmi-ipmiconsole

ipmi-sensors to check
---------------------
don't output event sensors on simple output
output based on event-type, not record type (i.e. discrete sensor can be listed in a full record, need not be stored in a compact record)
threshold outputs correct
disable dumping
clear command line arguments
flush non-default cache
output appropriate error when non-root
