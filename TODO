Al's TODO list
==============
libfreeipmi:

  * only make those symbols exportable that should be exportable
  * gcc 4.0 test/warning
  * int wraparound corner cases - fiid
    - uint32_t for max_field_len, but some funcs return int32_t
    - counters, fiid_obj_create
  * test bad seq nums
  * need to test
    - acpi
    - ssif
    - pef config
  * re-architect ipmi-error.c stuff to handle different commands with same values.
  * sensor-event-messages: get_28_event_data3_messages
  * cleanup

ipmipower
---------
  * compile options to make workarounds automatic for ipmipower
  * activate session - check auth-type of return

General:
--------
  * sel aggregator

Autoconf/Portability
--------------------
  * socklet_t, doesn't exist on all OSes.

Bala's TODO List:
=================
  * lan based sensors, sel and bmc-info
  * bmc-config --auto-configure
  * sensors will be simplified with Scheme <DONE>
  * dual fiid for ipmi_kcs_lan_set_auth_type_enables

Ian's TODO List:
================
  * Convert fish to the (now preferred) scm_ interface completely.
  * Event Messaging and PEF Subsystem.

Later on:
=========
  * Host monitoring support: Ganglia integration.
  * Additional libfreeipmi examples.
  * Code auditing
    - Templates/API/etc: Some say "username" some have "user_name".
    - Lots of functions don't check input parameters, i.e. null buffers
