bmc-config/pef-config
-------------------
bmc/pef-config - parsing bad, re-design, output error info
---
load entire file into mem in list/array of sections
- each section has list of key=value pairs
pass "section" to each appropriate section handler for invalid-value checks/key-checks
if that passes, pass "section" to each appropriate checkout/commit/etc. area
each area can do whatever they want
should do everything in chunks when it is possible, do individually if there were errors
---
common stuff for parsing in bmc-config and pef-config
fix poor use of atoi/strtoul
common pef junk
remote bmc-autoconfig?

general
-------
event handling

------------
move set power cycle interval to bmc-config?
