freeipmi tools
--------------
config via environment variables too - like config file
comma output - support in ipmi-sel, ipmi-sensors, ipmimonitoring

libfreeipmi
-----------
* how to support xRC4 (can we? should we? does any vendor support this?)
* abstract FRU parsing into lib?
* more detailed debug output for ssif interface like KCS interface
  - don't have a SSIF ipmi system, so shouldn't develop until I have a
    system I can test on?
* document templates in .h files or something
  - split up and make '-template" .h files"

units
-----
support modifier unit/rate unit in sensor output/monitoring/sel 

sensors/sel/monitoring
----------------------
--compacted option? squeeze output together?

sensors/monitoring
------------------
make sure bridging still works w/ sensor-read lib
make sure oem still outputs fine

sunbmc driver
-------------
untested - need solaris hardware

ipmi-chassis-config
-------------------
* conf.5 manpage
- panel button config (need to test against hardware)

general
-------
beginning doc for developers
event handling
try and consolidate checks/etc code in ipmipower/ipmiconsole/api
-x option for excluding hosts??
firmware firewall support?
- new config tool??

config
------
config file - support workarounds/etc. for heterogenous cluster?

bmc-device
--------
get auxiliary log status
- not tested, don't have a machine with this support

pef-config
-----------
* conf.5 manpage

inband code
-----------
retry/resent code?

ipmi-sensors-config
-------------------
* conf.5 manpage
* instructions for each section??

IPv6
----
- well, IPMI only supports IPv4, so I suppose there is no need for
this for now.  Just watch for it in the future.

ipmb
----
ipmi 2.0 bridging - untested
openipmi ipmb - untested

libs
----
merge all libs into one?  would aid debian packaging.
- make package layout simpler?
- make .so-naming consistent?
- merge all except libipmidetect?

contribs
--------
module for snmptrapd to parse ipmi traps
zenoss
- request from someone

DCMI functionality
------------------
http://www.intel.com/technology/product/DCMI/index.htm
- new FreeIPMI tool? or separate project? or contrib project?
  - probably a contrib project
- nothing special as a whole, mostly already IPMI 2.0 with a few new
additions.
- get dcmi capabilities info
  - the typical what is dcmi supported and version info junk
- get asset tag
  - seems useless.  gets asset tag, but the asset tag is already
    stored in the FRU (and output via normal FRU output in ipmi-fru.)
  - if supported, make ipmi-fru stuff into lib or steal code 
    from ipmi-fru for parsing.
- get dcmi sensor info command
  - seems useless, only gets the SDR #s of specific sensors
    DCMI cares about?  But sensors already should be output by
    ipmi-sensors/ipmimonitoring/etc.
- get power reading
- get power limit
- set power limit
- activate/deactive power limit
  - these 4 commands seem like the only maybe potentially useful
    additions.

FreeIPMI X.X.X has been released.

The release can be downloaded at:

http://www.gnu.org/software/freeipmi/download.html

or 

http://ftp.zresearch.com/pub/freeipmi/

FreeIPMI provides in-band and out-of-band IPMI software based on the
IPMI v1.5/2.0 specification.  The IPMI specification defines a set of
interfaces for platform management and is implemented by a number
vendors for system management.  The features of IPMI that most users
will be interested in are sensor monitoring, system event monitoring,
power control, and serial-over-LAN (SOL).  The FreeIPMI tools and
libraries listed provide users with the ability to access
and utilize these and many other features of IPMI.
