AB's TODO list
==============
libfreeipmi:
------------
[HIGH PRIORITY]
  * Nil

[MEDIUM PRIORITY]
  * Missing IPMI commands.
  * Modify system boot priority table.

[LOW PRIORITY]
  * FRU Commands (SDR Repo does a similar job).
  * Command to Switch MUX between BMC and ttyS1

Al's TODO list
==============
libfreeipmi:
------------
  * IPMI 1.5 Errata - Get Chassis Status 
  * Consider encapsulating length, ids, types in fiid_obj_t
    and fiid_template_t down the road.
  * ipmi_sdr_repo_cache_seek: Add hash/array pointers to avoid
    seeking.  Will probably require a "load and create" wrapper
    function of some sort.
  * Feature to allow atomicity of multiple IPMI commands in a row.
    May or may not be possible.  Think about it.
  * Auto retries in ipmi_lan_cmd()
  * open_lan_session - modify to use best secure connection available
  
fish:
-----
  * Create makefile wrappers to allow fish to work locally in
    build directory rather that requiring installation.
  * sel output includes more watchdog timer info

bmc-watchdog:
-------------
  * Require Timer use to be SMS/OS?
  * Allow over lan?

ipmipower:
----------
  * Research and implement better packet analysis algorithms.
  * Output warning/error/message/something in autoconf if ipmipower
    cannot be compiled with locked pages??
  * There are probably port issues with mmap/mlock.
  * Re-implement BMC workaround to use ports less wastefully.
  * Buffer recently malloced space to avoid constant re-mallocing.
  * Add readline or similar functionality in interactive mode.
  * Multithread to increase speed on large clusters
    - already fast, so low priority 

ipmiping/rmcpping:
------------------
  * Make starting sequence number random to reduce probability of
    "confused" BMC known issue?
  * Randomizing port on client can also fix the issue??

General:
--------
  * Testsuite for Freeipmi and IPMI conformance test.
  * New tools?
    - SEL collector/logger thingie for clusters
    - tool/script to detect busted BMC/IORiser

Autoconf issues:
----------------
  * socklet_t, doesn't exist on all OSes.
  * stdarg.h, other OSes use varargs.h
  * bittypes.h and inttypes.h for u_int32_t, etc.
         
Bala's TODO List:
=================
  * lan based sensors, sel and bmc-info
  * bmc-config --auto-configure
  * automatic channel probing
  * sensors will be simplified with Scheme
  * Set assert tag
  * dual fiid for ipmi_kcs_lan_set_auth_type_enables

Ian's TODO List:
================
  * Convert fish to the (now preferred) scm_ interface completely.
  * Event Messaging and PEF Subsystem.

Later on:
=========
  * Host monitoring support: Ganglia integration.
  * Additional libfreeipmi examples.
  * Extra documentation on bmc-config
  * IPMI plugin for ethereal/tethereal/etc.
    - achu: Would this even require linking with FreeIPMI?  I have no
      idea.  Need to research this.
  * Code auditing
    - Templates/API/etc: Some say "username" some have "user_name".
    - Lots of functions don't check input parameters, i.e. null buffers
