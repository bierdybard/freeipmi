AB's TODO list
==============
libfreeipmi:
------------
[HIGH PRIORITY]
  * FreeIPMI Hackers Guide.
  * FreeIPMI FAQ.
  * Event Messaging and PEF Subsystem.
  * sel: better decoding of error messages. More info below...
    1. SELVIEW prints out description of post error which is valuable
    for debug while FreeIPMI SEL Viewer does not.
      *SELVIEW : System Firmware Error (POST Error). POST Code: 8140 -
                 Processor 01: failed FRB level 3 timer.
      *Free IPMI SEL viewer :   System Firmware Error (POST Error)
    2. SELVIEW prints out description of processor error while
    FreeIPMI SEL Viewer prints out. 
      *SELVIEW :  Correctable error in Processor CPU2 - J7M1D
      *FreeIPMI SEL viewer :   Processor #0:IERR:SMI Handler
    Thanks to Robin and Brian Rice for the above info.

[MEDIUM PRIORITY]
  * All commands (with few exceptions like lan-set-ipaddr) should have
    both LAN and KCS APIs.
  * Rest of other notable IPMI commands.
  * Modify system boot priority table.

[LOW PRIORITY]
  * FRU Commands (SDR Repo does a similar job).
  * Set Asset Tag
  * Command to Switch MUX between BMC and ttyS1

Al's TODO list
==============

General

Cleanup use of autoconf defs.  i.e. use "/* HAVE_FOO_H */" and etc.

Libfreeipmi

- IPMI 1.5 Errata - Get Chassis Status 
- Consider encapsulating length, ids, types in fiid_obj_t
  and fiid_template_t down the road.
- ipmi_sdr_repo_cache_seek: Add hash/array pointers to avoid
  seeking.  Will probably require a "load and create" wrapper
  function of some sort.
- Feature to allow atomicity of multiple IPMI commands in a row.
  - May or may not be possible.  Think about it.
  
Fish

- Create makefile wrappers to allow fish to work locally in
  build directory rather that requiring installation.

Bmc-watchdog

- Add probing for proper base address
- Require Timer use to be SMS/OS?
- Make get_lan_channel_number() non-hardcoded.
- Ignore pre-timeout interval length comparison to initial countdown
if pre-timeout interval is none

Ipmipower

- Research and implement better packet analysis algorithms.
- Output warning/error/message/something in autoconf if ipmipower
  cannot be compiled with locked pages??
- There are probably port issues with mmap/mlock.
- Re-implement BMC workaround to use ports less wastefully.
- Buffer recently malloced space to avoid constant re-mallocing.
- Add readline or similar functionality in interactive mode.
- get rid of the ping-consec-count option, that thing is useless

Ipmiping/Rmcpping

- Make starting sequence number random to reduce probability of
"confused" BMC known issue?
- Randomizing port on client can also fix the issue??

General

Autoconf issues:
- socklet_t, doesn't exist on all OSes.
- stdarg.h, other OSes use varargs.h
- bittypes.h and inttypes.h for u_int32_t, etc.
- default io-port config option?

Testsuite for Freeipmi and IPMI conformance test.

Need to test following corner cases:
- 16 byte passwords
- passwords with spaces

New tools?
- SEL collector/logger thingie for clusters
- tool/script to detect busted BMC/IORiser
- bmc-config wrapper script to handle common stuff
  - i.e. if you enable a user, automatically turn on
         IPMI lan and IPMI serial, passwd/md2 authentication,
         etc.
         

Bala's TODO List:
=================
*/* 2004-02-16 15:25 bala: dual fiid for ipmi_kcs_lan_set_auth_type_enables
*/* 2004-08-18 07:37 bala: sensors will be simplified with Scheme
*/* 2004-08-18 07:37 bala: SDR Validation code
*/* 2004-08-18 07:37 bala: sensor min/max reading, normal min/max,
nominal reading, event/reading type code should be moved to Very
Verbose in sensors.

Ian's TODO List:
================
Convert fish to the (now preferred) scm_ interface completely.

Later on:
=========

Host monitoring support
- Ganglia?
