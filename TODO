libfreeipmi:
------------
* Missing IPMI commands.
  - lan-cmds 
  - msg-support-cmds
  - chassis-cmds
  - serial-cmds
  - sol-cmds
  - pef-cmds
  - sdr-repo-cmds
  - sel-cmds
  - sdr-record-types
  - sel record-types
  - sensor-cmds
* how to support xRC4 (can we? should we? does any vendor support this?)

ipmipower
---------
- redo to utilize newer api?
- use generic argp - not unique .h
  
bmc-config
----------
remaining serial config
power cycle interval
chassis boot params
- new chassis config tool?
- move power restore polcy over
advanced option??
acpi power state get/set??

pef-config
-----------
* conf.5 manpage
* how to specify event reading type codes easily

general
-------
event handling
try and consolidate checks/etc code in ipmipower/ipmiconsole/api
-x option for excluding hosts??
firmware firewall support?
- new config tool??

config
------
config file - support workarounds/etc. for heterogenous cluster?
map hostname -> IP config
consolidate ipmiconsole,ipmipower,ipmimonitoring config files into freeipmi.conf?
- after this, tweak "known issue" info about ps(1), put info in conf file, etc.
support hostranged commit/checkout in all config tools except bmc-config??

ipmiconsole
-----------
retry under a different port
- has never been tested, does any manufacturer do this?

ipmi-sensors-config
-------------------
* conf.5 manpage
35.10/35.11
- sensor enable/disable??
- sensor event enable/disable??

ipmi-sel
--------
get/set sel time

bmc-info
--------
also output guid info
warm/cold reset??
- new tool "bmc-device", make bmc-info a link that points back to it?

other tools support
-------------------
monitoring in nagios
- doesn't really support monitoring like ganglia.  Each script reports
a single ok vs. warning vs. critical.  Cannot monitor individual
sensors unless they are separate scripts.  Parallelism w/ ipmi-sensors
or ipmimonitoring is lost b/c they would be reported back to nagios in
only 1 sensor reading (probably not what you want).  Could support script that
does only 1 host??  But all this will report is ok vs. warning vs. critical
for *all* ipmi on that machine.  Worth it??
