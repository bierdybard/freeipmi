libfreeipmi:
------------
* Missing IPMI commands.
  - lan-cmds 
  - msg-support-cmds
  - chassis-cmds
  - serial-cmds
  - sol-cmds
  - pef-cmds
  - sdr-repo-cmds
  - sel-cmds
  - sdr-record-types
  - sel record-types
  - sensor-cmds
* Modify system boot priority table.
* how to support xRC4 (can we? should we?)
* get event messages function that is passed fiids

Autoconf/Portability
--------------------
* socklet_t, doesn't exist on all OSes.
* stdarg.h, other OSes use varargs.h
         
bmc-config:
-----------
Missing Serial Config
Chassis Config?

pef-config
-----------
* conf.5 manpage
* how to specify event reading type codes

bmc-config/pef-config
---------------------
bmc/pef-config - parsing bad, re-design, output error info
installed template
---
load entire file into mem in list/array of sections
- each section has list of key=value pairs
pass "section" to each appropriate section handler for invalid-value checks/key-checks
if that passes, pass "section" to each appropriate checkout/commit/etc. area
each area can do whatever they want
should do everything in chunks when it is possible, do individually if there were errors
---
common stuff for parsing in bmc-config and pef-config
fix poor use of atoi/strtoul
common pef config junk in bmc-config & pef-config
remove bmc-autoconfig?
- or needs to be fixed/updated before 0.5.0 release

general
-------
event handling
sdr caching requires versioning
tool for getting channel information - in ipmi-device tool for 0.5.0?
remove get authentication capabilities checks?

ipmi-chassis
------------
move set power cycle interval to bmc-config?
remove set power restore policy b/c its in bmc-config?
put boot options into bmc-config?

re-architecture
---------------
libfreeipmi re-arch for better error codes
udm strerror - w/ buffer for command specific errors
split udm into another lib

ipmiconsole
-----------
retry under a different port
- has never been tried/tested
common tests
- ipmiconsole_engine_teardown() before ipmiconsole_ctx_destroy()
- block vs. non_block
- engine_flags CLOSE_FD
- engine_flags OUTPUT_ON_SOL_ESTABLISHED
- serial-break
- garbage collection (i.e. mem-leaks happening)
- callback vs. non-callback
- ipmiconsole_ctx_destroy() - w/o closing fd - close session
- close fd from ipmiconsole_ctx_fd()  - close session
- fd-leaks

ASUS issues to resolve
----------------------
K_g status from get channel authentication capabilities incorrect (P5MT-R)
SOL report incorrect port (P5MT-R)
duplicate seq number (P5M2)
SOL config read (P5M2, P5MT-R)
get/st payload access (P5M2, P5MT-R)
invalid RAKP2 err code (P5MT-R)
