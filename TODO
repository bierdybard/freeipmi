Testing TODO
============
* APIs
  - acpi
  - ssif
  - pef config

* ipmi 2.0
  - ipmipower + libfreeipmi
      k_g
  - bmc-config
      security keys (k_r, k_g)

AB's TODO list
==============
libfreeipmi:
------------
[HIGH PRIORITY]
  * Unified Driver Model (one interface for all in-band and out-of-band drivers)

[MEDIUM PRIORITY]
  * Missing IPMI commands.
  * Modify system boot priority table.

[LOW PRIORITY]
  * FRU Commands (SDR Repo does a similar job).
  * Command to Switch MUX between BMC and ttyS1

Al's TODO list
==============
bmc-config
----------
  * document password 20 bytes
  * not output password twice?

libfreeipmi:
------------
  * Different slave address than BMC as default (i.e. in fill_lan_msg_hdr)
  * only make those symbols exportable that should be exportable
  * how to support xRC4
  * gcrypt: secure mem-buffers
  * int wraparound corner cases - fiid
    - uint32_t for max_field_len, but some funcs return int32_t
    - counters, fiid_obj_create
  * missing cmds
    - lan-cmds 
    - msg-support-cmds
    - chassis-cmds
    - serial-cmds
    - sol-cmds
    - pef-cmds
    - sdr-repo-cmds
    - sel-cmds
    - sdr-record-types
    - sel record-types
    - sensor-cmds
  * template raw for all raw functions
    - begininning with tmpl_lan_raw
  * get event messages function that is passed fiids
  * lan ctx interface?
  * len -> length
    - fiid?
  * template "tagging" mechanism to make template compares faster
  * allow configuration of the slave addr into lan_msg_hdr??
  * assemble_raw, unassemble_raw
    - then using these, udm-raw can be adjusted
  * deal with set_user_password_rq variable length problem differently?

fish:
-----
  * Create makefile wrappers to allow fish to work locally in
    build directory rather that requiring installation.

ipmipower
---------
  * compile options to make workarounds automatic for ipmipower

General:
--------
  * sel aggregator

Autoconf/Portability
--------------------
  * socklet_t, doesn't exist on all OSes.
  * stdarg.h, other OSes use varargs.h
  * bittypes.h and inttypes.h for u_int32_t, etc.
         
Bala's TODO List:
=================
  * lan based sensors, sel and bmc-info
  * bmc-config --auto-configure
  * sensors will be simplified with Scheme <DONE>
  * dual fiid for ipmi_kcs_lan_set_auth_type_enables
  * convert ipmi-sensors, ipmi-sel, bmc-config to C based tools rather
    than Scheme based tools

Ian's TODO List:
================
  * Convert fish to the (now preferred) scm_ interface completely.
  * Event Messaging and PEF Subsystem.

Later on:
=========
  * Host monitoring support: Ganglia integration.
  * Additional libfreeipmi examples.
