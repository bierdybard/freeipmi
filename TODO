libfreeipmi:
------------
* Missing IPMI commands.
  - lan-cmds 
  - msg-support-cmds
  - chassis-cmds
  - serial-cmds
  - sol-cmds
  - pef-cmds
  - sdr-repo-cmds
  - sel-cmds
  - sdr-record-types
  - sel record-types
  - sensor-cmds
* how to support xRC4 (can we? should we? does any vendor support this?)

ipmipower
---------
- redo to utilize newer api?
- remove auto features to make consistent to other tools
  X- auto privilege
    X - priv level operator by default
    - use real priv, not enum junk
    - before power op, check privilege level
  X - auto version
    X - remove ipmi-version in ipmipower_powercmd_t
    X - legacy ipmi-version command to driver type
  X - auto authentication
  X  - auth type md5
    - use real auth types, not ipmipower auth types
  X- auto cipher suite
  X  - cipher suite 3 default
    - use numbers, not stupid enums
  X - many version/highest_received_seq_num etc. move to init
  - to test
    X - ipmi 2.0 not found
    X - password length ipmi 1.5 nad ipmi 2.0
    X - auth type not supported
    X - priv level not enough for op
    X priv level not obtainable
    X ipmi 1.5
    X ipmi 2.0
    X cipher suite ids not obtainable
  X- msg types all still used? audit.
   - remove cipher suite record lookup??
- use generic argp - not unique .h
  X - use common manpage stuff now that auto is gone
  
bmc-config
----------
remaining serial config
power cycle interval
chassis boot params
- new chassis config tool?
- move power restore polcy over
advanced option??
acpi power state get/set??
only output lan-conf-auth sections is supported via supported field

pef-config
-----------
* conf.5 manpage
* how to specify event reading type codes easily

general
-------
event handling
try and consolidate checks/etc code in ipmipower/ipmiconsole/api
-x option for excluding hosts??
firmware firewall support?
- new config tool??
audit ls/ms byte usage
- fiid internally stores ls byte first, so if spec says ms byte first, need to fix
code cleanup
- merge many util libs into one?
different priv config for tools
fix poort variable naming in argp for all tools
- audit macros in tool-cmdline-common .. are all still used?
- audit common doc manpages, all still used?

config
------
config file - support workarounds/etc. for heterogenous cluster?
- re-work ipmiconsole to allow command line option to work
map hostname -> IP config
map hostname -> IP config
- 1) deal w/ tools
  - core tools
  - config tools
  - ipmiconsole
  - ipmipower
  - rmcpping
  - ipmiping
- 2) -E options
- 3) ipmidetect
  - how deal w/ duplicate althost point to same ipmihost?
- 4) invalid hostname errors
- 5) alternate hostmap file option in tools
- 6) output debug along w/ --debug
- 7) prefix debug output correctly
- in branch hostmap_branch?  Abandon?
  - complicates functionality of freeipmi
    - how support in rmcpping/ipmiping? w/ debug abilities?
    - how support in ipmidetect?
      - ipmidetect can only work off ipmi ip addresses.
      - would it output mapped or ipmi ip addresses?
    - support in some tools but not others?
    - seems not worth effort - this is something upper level software
      should handle.  Not something that should be handled in FreeIPMI.
    - if revisit, put in freeipmi.conf?
consolidate ipmiconsole,ipmipower,ipmimonitoring config files into freeipmi.conf?
- after this, tweak "known issue" info about ps(1), put info in conf file, etc.
- also update comments in contrib ganglia/nagios.
support hostranged commit/checkout in all config tools except bmc-config??

ipmiconsole
-----------
retry under a different port
- has never been tested, does any manufacturer do this?
use argp 

ipmi-sensors-config
-------------------
* conf.5 manpage
35.10/35.11
- sensor enable/disable??
- sensor event enable/disable??

0.7.0
-----
add contributions (ganglia/nagios) to webpage downloads
update index w/ new bmc-info text.
update w/ bmc-device index.htp
update w/ bmc-device manpage
links to ganglia/nagios??

other monitoring
----------------
with clumon? - don't know how popular it is
