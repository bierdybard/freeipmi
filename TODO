AB's TODO list
==============
libfreeipmi:
------------
[HIGH PRIORITY]
  * FreeIPMI Hackers Guide.
  * FreeIPMI FAQ.
  * Event Messaging and PEF Subsystem.

[MEDIUM PRIORITY]
  * All commands (with few exceptions like lan-set-ipaddr) should have
    both LAN and KCS APIs.
  * Rest of other notable IPMI commands.
  * Modify system boot priority table.

[LOW PRIORITY]
  * FRU Commands (SDR Repo does a similar job).
  * Set Asset Tag
  * Command to Switch MUX between BMC and ttyS1

Al's TODO list
==============

General

Cleanup use of autoconf defs.  i.e. use "/* HAVE_FOO_H */" and etc.

Libfreeipmi

- IPMI 1.5 Errata - Get Chassis Status 
- Consider encapsulating length, ids, types in fiid_obj_t
  and fiid_template_t down the road.
- ipmi_sdr_repo_cache_seek: Add hash/array pointers to avoid
  seeking.  Will probably require a "load and create" wrapper
  function of some sort.
- Feature to allow atomicity of multiple IPMI commands in a row.
  - May or may not be possible.  Think about it.
  
Fish

- Create makefile wrappers to allow fish to work locally in
  build directory rather that requiring installation.

Bmc-watchdog

- Add probing for proper base address
- Require Timer use to be SMS/OS?
- Make get_lan_channel_number() non-hardcoded.
- Fix debugging output.

Ipmipower

- Research and implement better packet analysis algorithms.
- Output warning/error/message/something in autoconf if ipmipower
  cannot be compiled with locked pages??
- There are probably port issues with mmap/mlock.
- Re-implement BMC workaround to use ports less wastefully.
- Buffer recently malloced space to avoid constant re-mallocing.
- Add readline or similar functionality in interactive mode.

Ipmiping/Rmcpping

- Make starting sequence number random to reduce probability of
"confused" BMC known issue?

General

Autoconf issues:
- socklet_t, doesn't exist on all OSes.
- stdarg.h, other OSes use varargs.h
- bittypes.h and inttypes.h for u_int32_t, etc.

Testsuite for Freeipmi and IPMI conformance test.

Need to test following corner cases:
- 16 byte passwords
- passwords with spaces

Bala's TODO List:
=================
*/* 2004-02-16 15:25 bala: dual fiid for ipmi_kcs_lan_set_auth_type_enables
