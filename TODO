  - lan-cmds 
  - msg-support-cmds
  - chassis-cmds
  - serial-cmds
  - sol-cmds
  - pef-cmds
  - sdr-repo-cmds
  - sel-cmds
  - sdr-record-types
  - sel record-types
  - sensor-cmds
* Modify system boot priority table.
* how to support xRC4 (can we? should we?)
* get event messages function that is passed fiids

Autoconf/Portability
--------------------
* socklet_t, doesn't exist on all OSes.
* stdarg.h, other OSes use varargs.h
         
bmc-config:
-----------
Missing Serial Config
Chassis Config?

management:
-----------

docs/ - delete all?

move ftp server

move webpage?

ipmi-pef
--------
* ipmi-pef renamed to pef-config
* .8 manpage and conf.5 manpage
* how to deal with channel number for alert policy table
* making config options more reasonable/easy to understand
* alert strings
* how to specify event reading type codes
  - better input for most of event filter section
* pef alert strings

bmc-config/ipmi-pef
-------------------
better parsing/caching for faster commit/checkout
mem-leaks from strdups, is this ever freed?
get functions - too much duplication, can be condensed - need to re-architect in some way
keypair/section on command line free mem

general
-------
timeout options for most FreeIPMI tools?
ipmi 2.0 for all tools?
sdr caching requires versioning

code cleanup
------------
param->parameter everywyhere 
- after ipmi-chassis committed
merge in freeipmi-udm
- after ipmi-chassis, ipmi-fru, and ipmi-pef committed
common funcs for udm setup in tools
common funcs for pstdout setup in tools
common funcs for sdr init junk in tools
common stuff for SDR options in manpages
common stuff for parsing in bmc-config and ipmi-pef
add header comments to fiid.h
