.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B Ipmi-oem
is used to execute OEM specific IPMI commands.  It is intended to
provide a better user interface for OEM specific IPMI commands rather
than using
.B ipmi-raw(8).

Please see SUPPORTED OEM IDS and COMMANDS below for a list of
supported OEM specific IPMI commands.  A list of supported OEM
specific commands may also be generated using the \fB\-\-list\fR
option.

There are no guarantees that the below OEM commands will work on any
particular motherboard.  OEM extensions may or may not exist on
particular hardware revisions and/or firmware revisions of
motherboards.  The extensions may or may not function for other lines of
motherboards from the same manufacturer.

.SH "IPMI-OEM OPTIONS"
The following options are specific to
.B Ipmi-oem.
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR
List supported OEM IDs and Commands.
.SH "SUPPORTED OEM IDS and COMMANDS"
The currently supported OEM IDs and COMMANDs are:
.TP
.B dell
.RS
.TP
.B get-system-info \fIasset-tag|service-tag|product-name\fR
This OEM command can retrieve the motherboard asset tag, service tag,
or product name.  Command confirmed to work on Dell Poweredge 2900 and
R610.
.TP
.B get-nic-selection
This OEM command will determine the current NIC selection for IPMI as
dedicated, shared, shared w/ failover to NIC2, or shared w/ failover
to all.  Dedicated indicates IPMI is only available on an expansion
card, shared indicates IPMI is available on NIC1, shared w/ failover
to NIC2 indicates IPMI is available on NIC1 w/ failover to NIC2 on
NIC1's failure, and shared w/ failover to all indicates IPMI is
available on NIC1 w/ failover to all other NICs in the event of NIC
failure.  On older Poweredge systems, 'shared w/ failover to NIC2' may
have been documented as just 'failover'.  Command confirmed to work on
Dell Poweredge 2900 and R610.
.TP
.B set-nic-section \fIdedicated|shared|shared_failover_nic2|shared_failover_all\fR
This OEM command will set the current NIC selection to dedicated,
shared, shared_failover_nic2, or shared_failover_all.  (See
\fIget\-nic\-selection\fR above for description on inputs.)  Command
confirmed to work on Dell Poweredge 2900 and R610.
.TP
.B get-power-info
This OEM command can retrieve power information.  Command confirmed to
work on Dell Poweredge R610.
.TP
.B reset-power-info \fIcumulative|peak\fI
This OEM command can reset the cumulative or peak power information
readings (viewed via \fBget\-power\-info\fR).  Command confirmed to
work on Dell Poweredge R610.
.TP
.B get-fcb-version
This OEM command can retrieve the fan control board (FCB) version
number.  Command confirmed to work on Dell Xanadu2.
.if 0 \{
.TP
.B get-dhcp-retry
This OEM command will retrieve DHCP retry information.
.TP
.B set-dhcp-retry \fIretry-count\fR \fIretry-interval\fR \fIretry-timeout\fR
This OEM command will set DHCP retry information.  The
\fIretry\-count\fR is one-based, max of 254, 0 or "none" will
configure no retries, 255 or "infinite" with configure constant
retries.  The \fIretry\-interval\fR is one-based, in 10 second
increments (i.e. 1 = 10 seconds).  The \fIretry\-timeout\fR is
one-based, in 1 minute increments (i.e. 1 = 1 minute).  Command
confirmed to work on Dell Xanadu2.
\}
.TP
.B get-sol-inactivity-timeout
This OEM command will retrieve the SOL inactivity timeout.
.TP
.B set-sol-inactivity-timeout \fIinactivity-timeout\fR
This OEM command will set the SOL inactivity timeout.  The
\fIinactivity-timeout\fR is one-based, max of 65535, in 1 minute
increments (i.e. 1 = 1 minute), 0 or "none" will configure no timeout.
.RE
.TP
.B inventec
.RS
.TP
.B get-nic-status
This OEM command will determine the current NIC status as dedicated or
shared.  Dedicated indicates IPMI is only available on the dedicated
management port.  Shared indicates IPMI is also available on one of
the primary ethernet ports.  Command confirmed to work on Inventec
5441 (and subsequently Dell Xanadu2).
.TP
.B set-nic-status \fIdedicated|shared\fR
This OEM command will set the current NIC status to dedicated or
shared.  (See \fIget\-nic\-status\fR above for description on dedicated
vs. shared status.)  This OEM command may internally reset the BMC,
making the BMC unusable for awhile.  Command confirmed to work on
Inventec 5441 (and subsequently Dell Xanadu2).
.TP
.B get-mac-address\fR
This command will retrieve the BMC MAC address.  This is actually not
an OEM command, but rather the normal IPMI MAC address command
(identical to what is used in the
.B bmc-config(8)
tool).  This command is placed here for convenience.
.TP
.B set-mac-address \fIdedicated|shared\fR \fIMACADDR\fR
This OEM command will set the dedicated or shared BMC MAC address.
(See \fIget\-nic\-status\fR above for description on dedicated
vs. shared status.)  The BMC MAC address cannot be set through the
normal IPMI MAC address command (what is used in the
.B bmc-config(8)
tool).  The MACADDR should be specified in XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX form.  A
shared BMC MAC address may conflict with normal communication ethernet
communication on the primary ethernet port.  Users may wish to
configuration an alternate MAC address instead.  After configuration
of the MAC address, the BMC must be reset.  This may be accomplished
by executing a cold-reset with
.B bmc-device(8).
Command confirmed to work on Inventec 5441 (and subsequently Dell Xanadu2).
.TP
.B get-bmc-services
This OEM command will display the currently enables BMC services.
Command confirmed to work on Inventec 5441 (and subsequently Dell Xanadu2).
.TP
.B set-bmc-services \fIenable|disable\fR \fIall|kvm|http|ssh\fR
This OEM command will enable or disable other BMC services besides
IPMI.  \fIall\fR can be specified to enable/disable all services,
\fIkvm\fR specifies KVM and Virtual Storage, \fIhttp\fR specifies HTTP
and HTTPS, and \fIssh\fR specifies both SSH and Telnet.  Command
confirmed to work on Inventec 5441 (and subsequently Dell Xanadu2).
.RE
.TP
.B supermicro
.RS
.TP
.B reset-intrusion 
This OEM command will reset the motherboard intrusion flag after it
has been triggered.  For example, in
.B ipmi-sensors
or
.B ipmi-sel,
you may notice a 'General Chassis Intrusion' if the motherboard
chassis is not open, but was opened in the past.  Command confirmed to
work on Supermicro H8QME.
