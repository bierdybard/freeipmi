.SH "NAME"
ipmidetectd \- IPMI node detection monitoring daemon
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B ipmidetectd [OPTIONS]
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The
.B ipmidetectd
daemon regularly sends out IPMI pings to determine if nodes have
functioning IPMI interfaces or not.  It is primarily used to determine
those nodes in the cluster that are not functioning properly, allowing
IPMI commands to be executed across the cluster faster by skipping those
nodes that would automatically timeout.
.LP
The 
.B ipmidetectd
daemon must be configured using the 
.B ipmidetectd 
configuration file.  Until
hosts to be pinged are configured, 
.B ipmidetectd 
will not function properly.
.LP
See the
.BR ipmidetectd.conf(5)
manpage for additional information.
