.TH Ipmidetect 8 "February 2007" "Ipmidetect @VERSION@" "Ipmidetect"
.SH NAME
ipmidetect \- list detected and/or undetected IPMI interfaces in a cluster
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ipmidetect
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fINODES\fR]...
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ipmidetect
lists which IPMI nodes have been detected or undetected in a cluster.
This information is provided by the
.B libipmidetect(3)
library
and
.B ipmidetectd(8)
daemon.

.B ipmidetect
will output the status of each IPMI node configured with
.B ipmidetectd(8)
unless they are specified on the command line.  If the first node
listed is "-", nodes will be read in from standard input.  The nodes
can be listed in hostrange format, comma separated lists, or space
separated lists.  See the section below on HOST RANGES for
instructions on how to list hosts in hostrange format.  The hostnames
listed must be the shortened names of hostnames.

.SH HOST RANGES
As noted in sections above,
.B ipmidetect
accepts ranges of hostnames in the general form: prefix[n-m,l-k,...],
where n < m and l < k, etc., as an alternative to explicit lists of
hosts.  This form should not be confused with regular expression
character classes (also denoted by ``[]''). For example, foo[19] does
not represent foo1 or foo9, but rather represents a degenerate range:
foo19.

This range syntax is meant only as a convenience on clusters with a
prefixNN naming convention and specification of ranges should not be
considered necessary -- the list foo1,foo9 could be specified as such,
or by the range foo[1,9].

Some examples of range usage follow:

List all nodes among foo01,foo02,...,foo05 that are detected/undetected 
    ipmidetect foo[01-05]

List all nodes among foo7,foo9,foo10 that are detected/undetected
    ipmidetect foo[7,9-10]

As a reminder to the reader, some shells will interpret brackets ('['
and ']') for pattern matching.  Depending on your shell, it may be
necessary to enclose ranged lists within quotes.  For example, in
tcsh, the above two examples should be executed as:

    ipmidetect "foo[01-05]"
    ipmidetect "foo[7,9-10]"
