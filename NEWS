0.7.1 - 00/00/00
----------------

Tools - New Significant Additions/Features
------------------------------------------
o Add new tool bmc-device to support advanced BMC commands including
  cold reset, warm reset, setting BMC times, and more.
o Support FreeIPMI configuration file for most tools (bmc-config,
  bmc-info, bmc-device, bmc-watchdog, ipmi-chassis, ipmi-fru,
  ipmi-oem, ipmi-raw, ipmi-sel, ipmi-sensors, ipmi-sensors-config,
  ipmiconsole, ipmimonitoring, ipmipower, pef-config) to avoid
  typing common options on the command line.  See
  freeipmi.conf(5) for more information.
o Add hostrange support in bmc-config, ipmi-sensors-config, and
  pef-config to support parallel configuration on a cluster.
o Add additional "connection timeout" error message to tools to
  differentiate between no IPMI communication at all vs. session
  timeout in the middle of a command's operations.
o Support hysteresis and sensor event configuration in
  ipmi-sensors-config.
o Support additional sensor monitoring interpretations in ipmimonitoring.
o Output additional sensor information in ipmi-sensors under very verbose
  mode, such as event enable information.
o Support --always-prefix option in most tools for easier scripting.
o Support --sdr-cache-recreate in all SDR related tools for easier
  scripting.
o Support --guid option in bmc-info to retrieve global ID.
o Support build on Solaris.

Tools - Enhancements/Changes/Bug Fixes
--------------------------------------
o Global in most tools
  - Rename --no-probing option to --disable-auto-probe for consistency
    in FreeIPMI.  Backwards compatability maintained.
o Global in config tools (bmc-config, pef-config, ipmi-sensors-config)
  - More carefully check for fatal vs. non-fatal errors when
    configuring.  This change may result in slight behavior
    differences.  For example, a session-timeout may have previously
    been considered a non-fatal error, making the config tools
    continue on attempting more configuration activities.  Now, it
    would error out on the first session-timeout indication.
o bmc-config
  - By default, do not output unsupported authentication type enables
    when checking out the Lan_Conf_Auth section.  Output unsupported
    authentication type enables under verbose output.
  - By default, do not output serial configuration parameters on checkout.
    Output serial configuration under verbose output.
  - Remove case sensitivity when checking a number of fields.
o ipmi-chassis
  - Alter ipmi-chassis output to print "unknown" when field is not known.
  - Alter some ipmi-chassis output text to be more consistent to IPMI
    spec.
o ipmi-fru
  - Output FRU device names along with IDs in ipmi-fru.
  - Reduce excessive newline outputs in ipmi-fru.
  - Output more information by default.  Change the output of verbose
    vs. very verbose output.
o ipmi-sel
  - Change default privilege from user to operator in ipmi-sel.
o ipmiconsole
  - Support --session-timeout and --retransmission-timeout options.
  - Removed -C short option for consistency to other tools.
  - Removed hostname config file option.  Require users to always input
    atleast hostname.
  - Changed primary config file to /etc/freeipmi.conf.  Legacy config
    file searched for and still supported.
  - Prefixed config file options with 'ipmiconsole' for consistency to
    new global FreeIPMI config file.  Old options still supported.
o ipmipower
  - Removed many early experimental features from ipmipower so
    ipmipower is more like other tools.  Removed ipmi-version,
    cipher-suite-id, privilege-level, and authentication-type auto
    discovery. Removed ability to enable/disable a number of experimental
    features.
  - Changed --config to --config-file in ipmipower for consistency to
    other tools.  Backwards compatability maintiained.
  - Replace --ipmi-version option with --driver-type.  Backwards
    compatability maintained.
  - Removed hostname config file option.  Require users to always input
    atleast hostname.
  - Changed primary config file to /etc/freeipmi.conf.  Legacy config
    file searched for and still supported.
  - Prefixed config file options with 'ipmipower' for consistency to
    new global FreeIPMI config file.  Old options still supported.
o ipmi-sensors
  - Check variety of corner cases such as whether sensor readings,
    hysteresis, thresholds, etc. are even available before reading
    them.  Some sensors may output slightly different information than
    before.  For example, suppose a power supply sensor exists for a
    power supply that is not installed.  If the sensor is enabled on
    the motherboard, ipmi-sensors would likely report "OK".  If the
    sensor is disabled on the motherboard, ipmi-sensors would likely
    report "NA".  Previously, "OK" would have been reported under both
    conditions.
  - Output multiple sensor status messages on separate lines, rather
    than all on one line under verbose modes.
  - When fields are not relevant, do not output as much information in
    verbose and very verbose mode.  For example, don't output
    hysteresis or threshold information for power supply sensors.
  - Alter some output ordering for consistency to IPMI spec.
o ipmimonitoring
  - Support -v verbose option to output sensors readings that aren't
    readable.
  - Check corner case for sensor readability.  May lead to slightly
    different output in ipmimonitoring.  For example, suppose a power
    supply sensor exists for a power supply that is not installed.  If
    the sensor is enabled on the motherboard, ipmimonitoring would
    normally report "Nominal".  If the sensor is disabled on the motherboard, 
    ipmimonitoring would normally not output a sensor state (it would
    output "N/A" under verbose mode). Previously, "Nominal" would have
    been reported under both conditions.
  - Output multiple bitmask strings if multiple bits are set.
  - Output "OK", similarly to ipmi-sensors when no bitmask strings are
    returned from a sensor reading.
o bmc-watchdog
  - Remove legacy 'v' option for version.

  - Add additional IPMI commands.

    '0.0' when a value is not truly available.  Fields that don't exist
    will not have a default output.
  o Fix incorrect hysterisis calculation and output.
