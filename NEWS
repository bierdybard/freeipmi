0.6.1
-----
For Users
---------
o Support --groups (plural) for multiple groups listing in
  ipmi-sensors.  Older --group (non-plural) option maintained for
  backwards compatability.
o Support --list-groups and --flush in ipmimonitoring for consistency
  to ipmi-sensors.
o Change --cache-dir to --sdr-cache-dir in ipmimonitoring for consistency
  to ipmi-sensors.
o Support shared SDR caches for ipmi-sensors, ipmi-fru, ipmi-sel, and
  ipmimonitoring.  (libipmimonitoring will still use a different
  default cache directory.)
o Modified SDR caching output messages in ipmi-sensors,
  ipmi-sel, ipmi-fru, and ipmimonitoring to provide more useful information.
o Updated SDR output under verbose and very verbose output modes with:
  o More IPMI compliant field names.  For example, 'Sensor Name' has
    been replaced with 'Sensor ID String'.
  o More correct output.  For example, 'NA' will be output instead of
    '0.0' when a value is not truly available.  Fields that don't exist
    will not have a default output.
  o Fix incorrect hysterisis calculation and output.
  o Fix incorrect OEM data output.
  o Support more SDR record types for output.
  o Output more SDR record information in general.
o Various other minor bug fixes, documentation fixes, and
  enhancements.

  changes include:
  o --priv-level and --privilege options are now --privilege-level.
  o --auth-type options are now --authentication-type.

  2) reg_space/register_space have been renamed to register_spacing globally.
  3) privilege has been replaced to privilege_level globally.
