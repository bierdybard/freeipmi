----------------
For Users
---------
o Add new tool ipmi-sensors-config.

  still use a different default cache directory.)  This will require a
  new cache generation for these tools.

    been replaced with 'ID String'.
  o More correct output.  For example, 'NA' will be output instead of
    '0.0' when a value is not truly available.  Fields that don't exist
    will not have a default output.
  o Fix incorrect hysterisis calculation and output.
  o Fix incorrect OEM data output.
  o Support more SDR record types for output.
