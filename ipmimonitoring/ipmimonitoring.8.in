.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
This version of ipmimonitoring was compiled with debugging.  When compiled
with debugging,
.B ipmimonitoring 
is insecure.  The following were intentionally
left in
.B ipmimonitoring
for debugging purposes:

.IP o 2
Command line arguments are not cleared from memory.
.IP o
Core dumps are enabled.

Before placing ipmimonitoring in a production system, it is recommended
that the program be compiled with debugging turned off.
