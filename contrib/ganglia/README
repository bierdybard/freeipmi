The ganglia scripts can be used to monitor IPMI sensors in ganglia via
FreeIPMI.  Please see instructions found at the top of each script for
details.

ganglia_ipmi_sensors.pl
-----------------------

Monitor via FreeIPMI's ipmi-sensors tool.

By default, this tool will monitor the state (Nominal, Warning, or
Critical) of each sensor as determined by libfreeipmi's interpret
library.  See freeipmi_interpret_sensors.conf(5) for more information.

By default, this tool will also monitor the sensor readings for
temperature, fan, and voltage sensors (e.g. 99.0 C, 130000.00 RPM, 1.2
V).
