.TH RMCPING 8 "@ISODATE@" "rmcpping @PACKAGE_VERSION@" "System Manager Commands"
.SH NAME
rmcpping \- send RMCP Ping to network hosts
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B rmcpping [OPTIONS] destination
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B rmcpping
uses the RMCP Ping request datagram to elicit an RMCP Pong response
from a remote host.  The utility can be used to verify if a remote
host supports RMCP or IPMI.  The initial starting sequence number will
be randomized.

.B rmcpping
will return 0 to the environment if it receives atleast 1 response
from the remote host.  Otherwise, it exits with a value of 1.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are available 
.TP
.I "-h"
Output help menu.
.TP
.I "-V"
Output version.
.TP
.I "-c count"
Stop after sending 
.I count
ping packets.
.TP
.I "-i interval"
Wait 
.I interval 
seconds between sending each packet.  The default is to wait for one
second between each packet normally.
.TP
.I "-I interface address"
Set source address to specified interface address. Argument may
be numeric IP address or name of device.
.TP
.I "-t timeout"
Time to wait for a response, in seconds. Default is 5 seconds.
.TP
.I "-v"
Verbose output.
.TP
.I "-s num"
Specify an initial starting sequence number.  The default is to use a
random initial sequence number.
.TP
.I "-d"
Turn on debugging.
.SH "LOCAL PING"
Unlike
.B ping(8),
.B rmcpping
cannot be used to ping a local network device (i.e. 127.0.0.1).
.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
It has been observed that some remote BMCs can get "confused" and
delay packet responses if duplicate packets are sent in succession
very quickly.  For example, this could happen if the user repeatedly
executes "ipmiping -c 1 -s X destination" very quickly.  There is no
known way to cleanly deal with a "confused" BMC other than the wait
awhile.
.SH "ORIGIN"
Developed by Albert Chu <chu11@llnl.gov> on LLNL's GNU/Linux clusters.
This software is open source and distributed under the terms of the
Gnu GPL.  Command and manpage based off 
.B ping(8).
.SH "SEE ALSO"
