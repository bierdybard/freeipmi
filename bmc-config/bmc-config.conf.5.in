bmc-config \- BMC configuration file format and details
.br
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Before many IPMI tools can be used over a network, a machine's
Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) must be configured.  The
configuration of a BMC can be quite daunting for those who do not know
much about IPMI.  This manpage hopes to provide enough information on
BMC configuration so that you can configure the BMC for your system.
When appropriate, typical BMC configurations will be suggested.
.LP
The following is an example BMC configuration file partially generated
from the
.B bmc-config(1)
command.  This example configuration should be sufficient for most
users after the appropriate local IP and MAC addresses are input.
Following this example, separate sections of this manpage will discuss
the different sections of the BMC configuration file in more detail
with explanations of how the BMC can be configured for different
environments.
.LP
Note that many options may or may not be available on your particular
machine.  For example, Serial-Over-Lan (SOL) is available only on IPMI
2.0 machines.  Therefore, if you are looking to configure an IPMI 1.5
machine, many of the SOL or IPMI 2.0 related options will be be
unavailable to you.  The number of configurable users may also vary
for your particular machine.
.LP
The below configuration file and most of this manpage assume the user
is interested in configuring a BMC for use with IPMI over LAN.
Various configuration options from 
.B bmc-config(1)
have been left out or skipped because it is considered unnecessary.
Future versions of this manpage will try to include more information.

.SH "Section User1, User2, ..."
The first sections of the BMC configuration file are for username
configuration of the BMC.  The number of users available to be
configured on your system will vary by manufacturer.  With the
exception of the Username for User1, all sections are identical.
.LP
The username(s) you wish to configure the BMC with are defined with
\fIUsername\fR.  The first username under Section User1 is typically
the NULL username and cannot be modified.  The password for the user
can be specified with \fIPassword\fR.  It can be left empty to define
a NULL password.  Each user you wish to enable must be enabled through
the \fIEnable_User\fR configuration option.  It is recommended that
all users have non-NULL passwords or be disabled for security reasons.
.LP
Under IPMI 2.0, 20 byte passwords have been allowed.  \fIPassword20\fR
can be used to set longer passwords.  Under most circumstances though,
it isn't necessary.  In the above configuration, we have chosen not to
use \fIPassword20\fR.
.LP
\fILan_Enable_Ipmi_Msgs\fR is used to enable or disable IPMI over LAN
access for the user.  This should almost always be enabled so that
IPMI over LAN tools like
.B ipmipower(8)
will work.
.LP
\fILan_Privilege_Limit\fR specifies the maximum privilege level limit
the user is allowed.  Different IPMI commands have different privilege
restrictions.  For example, determining the power status of a machine
only requires the "User" privilege level.  However, power cycling
requires the "Operator" privilege.  Typically, you will want to assign
atleast one user with the "Administrator" privilege so that all system
functions are available to atleast one user via IPMI over LAN.
.LP
\fISOL_Payload_Access\fR specifies if a particular user is allowed to
connect with Serial-Over-LAN (SOL).
.LP
The example configuration above disables "User2" but enables the
default "Anonymous" (or NULL) user.  Many IPMI tools (both open-source
and vendor) do not allow the user to input a username and assume the
NULL username by default.  If the tools you are interested in using
allow usernames to be input, then it is recommended that one of the
non-NULL usernames be enabled and the NULL username disabled for
security reasons.

.SH "Section Lan_Channel"
The Lan_Channel section configures a variety of IPMI over LAN
configuration parameters.  Both \fIVolatile\fR and \fINon_Volatile\fR
configurations can be set.  \fIVolatile\fR configurations are
immediately configured onto the BMC and will have immediate effect on
the system.  \fINon_Volatile\fR configurations are only available
after the next system reset.  Generally, both the \fIVolatile\fR and
\fINon_Volatile\fR should be configured identically.
.LP
The \fIAccess_Mode\fR parameter configures the availability of IPMI
over LAN on the system.  Typically this should be set to "Always_Available".
.LP
The \fIPrivilege_Limit\fR sets the maximum privilege any user of the
system can have when performing IPMI over LAN.  This should be set to
the maximum privilege level given to any of the previously defined
system users.  Typically, this should be set to "Administrator".
.LP
Typically \fIUser_Level_Auth\fR and \fIPer_Message_Auth\fR should be
enabled since disabling them lowers security requirements with
individual IPMI messages.  Disabling \fIUser_Level_Auth\fR allows "User" 
privileged IPMI commands to be executed without authentication.
Disabling \fIPer_Message_Auth\fR allows fewer individual IPMI messages
to require authentication.

.SH "Section Lan_Conf"
Those familiar with setting up networks should find most of the fields
in this section self explanatory.  The example BMC configuration above
illustrates the setup of a static IP address.  The field
\fIIP_Address_Source\fR is configured with "Static".  The IP address,
subnet mask, and gateway IP addresses of the machine are respecitvely
configured with the \fIIP_Address\fR, \fISubnet_Mask\fR,
\fIDefault_Gateway_Ip_Address\fR, and \fIBackup_Gateway_Ip_Address\fR
fields.  The respective MAC addresses for the IP addresses are
configured under \fIMac_Address\fR, \fIDefault_Gateway_Mac_Address\fR,
and \fIBackup_Gateway_Mac_Address\fR.
.LP
It is not required to setup the BMC \fIIP_Address\fR to be the same
\fIP_Address\fR used by your operating system for that network
interface.  However, if you choose to use a different address, an
alternate ARP configuration may need to be setup.
.LP
To instead setup your BMC network information via DHCP, the field
\fIIP_Address_Source\fR should be configured with "Use_DHCP".
.LP
It is recommended that static IP addresses be configured for address
resolution reasons.  See the Lan_Conf_Misc section below regarding
gratuitous arps for a more detailed explanation.

.SH "Section Lan_Conf_Auth"
This section determines what types of authentication mechanisms are
allowed for users at different privilege levels under the IPMI 1.5
protocol.  For example, should a user with "Administration" privileges
be allowed to authenticate with a straight password.
.LP
Generally speaking, you do not want to allow any user to authenticate
with \fINone\fR or \fIStraight_Password\fR.  \fINone\fR refers to
accepting NULL usernames and NULL passwords.  \fIStraight_Password\fR
means passwords will be sent over a network in cleartext.  \fIMd2\fR
and \fIMd5\fR are digital signature algorithms that can encrypt
passwords.  Typically, these are the only authentication options that
should be enabled.  In the above example, \fIMd2\fR and \fIMd5\fR are
the only authentication mechanisms that are enabled for users 
with "User", "Operator" and "Administrator" privileges.

.SH "Section Lan_Conf_Security_Keys"
This section supports configuration of the IPMI 2.0 K_g key.  The key
is used for two-key authentication in IPMI 2.0.  In most tools, when
doing IPMI 2.0, the K_g can be optionally specified.  It is not
required for IPMI 2.0 operation.
.LP
In the above example, we have elected to leave this field blank so the
K_g key is not used.

.SH "Section Lan_Conf_Misc"
This section lists miscellaneous IPMI over LAN configuration options.
Normally, these are optional IPMI configuration options that are not
implemented on all BMCs.
.LP
Normally, a client cannot resolve the ethernet MAC address without the
remote operating system running, Therefore IPMI over LAN would not
work when a machine is powered off.  One way to work around this is
through gratuitous ARPs.  Gratuitous ARPs are ARP packets generated by
the BMC and sent out to advertise the machine's IP to MAC address
mapping.  Other machines on the network can store this information in
their local ARP cache and allow IPMI over LAN to work when the remote
machine is powered off.  The \fIEnable_Gratuitous_Arps\fR option
allows you to enable or disable this feature.  The
\fIGratuitous_Arp_Interval\fR option allows you to configure the
frequency at which gratuitous ARPs are sent out onto the network.
.LP
Instead of gratuitous ARPs some BMCs are able to respond to ARP
requests, even when powered off.  If offerred, this feature can be
enabled through the \fIEnable_Arp_Response\fR option.
.LP
Generally speaking, turning on gratuitous ARPs is acceptable.
However, if you are using IPMI on a large cluster, the gratuitous ARPs
may easily flood your network.  They should be tuned to occur less
frequently or disabled.  If disabled, the remote machine's MAC address
should be permanently stored in the local ARP cache through 
.B arp(8).
.LP
See
.B bmc-watchdog(8)
for a method which allows gratuitous ARPs to be disabled when the
operating system is running, but enabled when the system is down.

.SH "Section Rmcpplus_Conf_Privilege"

.LP
The authentication algorithm is used for user authentication with the
BMC.  The integrity algorithm is used for generating signatures on
IPMI packets.  The confidentiality algorithm is used for encrypting
data.

Generally speaking, HMAC-SHA1 based algorithms are stronger than
HMAC-MD5, which are better than MD5-128 algorithms.  AES-CBC-128
confidentiality algorithms are stronger than xRC4-128 algorithms,
which are better than xRC4-40 algorithms.  Cipher suite ID 3 is
therefore typically considered the most secure.  Some users may wish
to set cipher suite ID 3 to a privilege level and disable all 
remaining cipher suite IDs.
.LP
The above example configuration has decided to allow any user with
"Administrator" privileges use any Cipher Suite algorithm suite which
requires an authentication, integrity, and confidentiality algorithm.

.SH "Section SOL_Conf"
This section is for setting up Serial-Over-Lan (SOL).  SOL can be
enabled with the \fIEnable_SOL\fR field.  The minimum privilege level
required for connecting with SOL is specified by
\fISOL_Privilege_Level\fR Authentication and Encryption can be forced
or not using the fields \fIForce_SOL_Payload_Authentication\fR and
\fIForce_SOL_Payload_Encryption\fR respectively.  It is recommended
that these be set on.
.LP
The \fICharacter_Accumulate_Interval\fR,
\fICharacter_Send_Threshold\fR , \fISOL_Retry_Count\fR and ,
\fISOL_Retry_Interval\fR options are used to set SOL character output
speeds. \fICharacter_Accumulate_Interval\fR determines how often
serial data should be regularly sent and
\fICharacter_Send_Threshold\fR indicates the character count that if
passed, will force serial data to be sent.  \fISOL_Retry_Count\fR
indicates how many times packets must be retransmitted if
acknowledgements are not received.  \fISOL_Retry_Interval\fR indicates
the timeout interval.  Generally, the manufacturer recommended numbers
will be sufficient.  However, you may wish to experiment with these
values if SOL is slow for you.
.LP
The \fINon_Volatile_Bit_Rate\fR and \fIVolatile_Bit_Rate\fR simply
determine the baudrate the BMC should use.  This should match the
baudrate set in the BIOS and any console access tools, such as 
.B agetty(8).  
Generally speaking, both the \fIVolatile\fR and \fINon_Volatile\fR
options should be set identically.
.LP
In addition to enabling SOL in this section, individual users most
also be capable of connecting with SOL.  See the section "Section
User1, User2, ..." above for details.  

.SH "Section Misc"
The \fIPower_Restore_Policy\fR determines the behavior of the machine
when AC power returns after a power loss.  The behavior can be set to
always power on the machine ("On_State_AC_Apply"), power off the
machine ("Off_State_AC_Apply"), or return the power to the state that
existed before the power loss ("Restore_State_AC_Apply").
