Bmc-config/Pef-config:

parse entire file
load entire file into mem in list/array of sections
- each section has list of key=value pairs
pass "section" to each appropriate section handler for invalid-value checks/key-checks

if that passes, pass "section" to each appropriate checkout/commit/etc. area

each area can do whatever they want

should do everything in chunks when it is possible, do individually if
there were errors


libfreeipmi:

udm -> separate lib 
- ping mailing list
- better error number handling
- need some consistency w/ other APIs and fill() libs 
- consistent error codes
- etc.
- perhaps give up on freeipmi_udm branch?
