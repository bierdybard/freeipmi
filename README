FreeIPMI
--------

FreeIPMI provides in-band and out-of-band IPMI software based on the
IPMI v1.5/2.0 specification.

FreeIPMI Project Libraries/Tools
--------------------------------

Libfreeipmi

A C library that includes KCS, SSIF, and OpenIPMI drivers, IPMI
1.5 and IPMI 2.0 LAN communication interfaces, IPMI packet building
utilities, IPMI command utilities, and utilities for
reading/interpreting/managing IPMI.

Bmc-info

A tool to read information about the local BMC such as version
information and device support.

Bmc-config

A tool to configure usernames, passwords, networking information,
security, and other relevant IPMI configuration fields.

Bmc-watchdog

A tool/daemon to manage a BMC Watchdog. This tool is typically used
for system timeout management and automatic system restarts in the
event of a system crash.  

Ipmi-chassis

A tool to manage/monitor a chassis, such as chassis power,
identification, and status.

Ipmi-fru

A tool to read field replaceable unit (FRU) information from a
motherboard/machine.

Ipmi-sel

A tool to read and manage IPMI System Event Log (SEL) records.  SEL
records store system event information and may be useful for debugging
problems.

Ipmi-sensors

A tool to read IPMI sensor readings and sensor data repository (SDR)
information.

Ipmipower

A tool for remote power control.

Ipmiconsole/Libipmiconsole

A tool and library for Serial-over-Lan (SOL) console access.

Ipmi-raw

A tool that provides hex input/output of IPMI commands.

Ipmi-locate

A tool that can probe for information about the location of a BMC
device, such as device addresses.

Ipmimonitoring/Libipmimonitoring

A tool and library for used for sensor interpretation/monitoring. The
tool is similar to ipmi-sensors, but sensor readings are analyzed and
mapped into Nominal, Warning, and Critical states.

Pef-config

A tool to configure IPMI Platform Event Filtering (PEF) configuration.

Ipmi-sensors-config

A tool to configure IPMI Sensors.

Ipmiping

An IPMI ping tool for debugging. 

Rmcpping

A RMCP ping tool for debugging. 

Ipmi-oem

An IPMI tool for OEM specific commands.

Ipmidetect/Ipmidetectd/libipmidetect

A tool, daemon, and library for IPMI node detection.

Getting Started with IPMI
-------------------------

IPMI can be used in-band (i.e. running on a machine locally) or
out-of-band (i.e. connecting remotely).

Most FreeIPMI tools can operate in-band by using one of the in-band
drivers included.  These in-band drivers include a direct KCS
interface driver, a SSIF driver through the SSIF device
(i.e. /dev/i2c-0), and the Linux OpenIPMI kernel driver
(i.e. /dev/ipmi0).  If your system requires the use of either of the
drivers, those appropriate modules must be installed ahead of time.
However, most systems should automatically load these drivers when
appropriate.

Under most scenarios, the FreeIPMI tools should automatically discover
which in-band interface to use and the proper settings to use.
However, some motherboards may require you to determine driver type,
addresses, paths, etc. on your own and pass them as command line
options to the tools.  You may use 'ipmi-locate' to help determine
this information.  Other tools such as 'dmidecode' may also provide
this information.   

To use IPMI out-of-band, the remote machine must first be configured
for out of band communication.  Typically, this involves setting a
username, password, IP address, MAC address, and a few other
parameters.  This can be done using the tool 'bmc-config'.  Additional
information on how to configure w/ bmc-config can be found in the
bmc-config.conf(5) manpage.  Some vendors may pre-configure their
motherboards with default values so that 'bmc-config' can be used
remotely to configure the machine.  However, most of the time,
'bmc-config' must be configured in-band before out-of-band access can
be allowed (for example, the IP address and MAC address must be
minimally configured first).

In order to remotely connect to a machine, you typically must specify
the host, username, and password for the tool in order to connect.
Depending on configuration settings, a K_g key, privilege level,
authentication type, cipher suite id, or protocol version may need to
be specified.  Some vendors may have not implemented IPMI properly and
a vendor specific workaround may also be necessary.  See tool manpages
for more information and general trouble-shooting information.

HPC Support
-----------

Much of FreeIPMI was written with HPC support in mind.  The
configuration tools 'bmc-config', 'pef-config', and
'ipmi-sensors-config' come with file input/output support so that
configuration can be copied and verified across nodes in a cluster.
Most tools come with hostrange support so multiple hosts can be
specified on the command line at the same time.  See tool manpages for
more information.  Also see the document freeipmi-hostrange.txt for
detailed usage and explanation.
